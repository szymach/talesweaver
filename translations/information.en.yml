    preface:
        header: Description
        content: >
            Talesweaver is an application created to help authors organize their
            work into easily managable chunks.
    structure:
        header: Structure
        content: >
            The most basic element of every piece is a scene. Scenes can be assigned
            to a chapter, which can be assigned to book.
    scene:
        header: Scene
        content: >
            Contains the actual content, you can add characters, items, location
            and events to them. These can be moved between scenes that are a part
            of the same chapter or book. The exception are events, which can only
            be assigned to single scene.
    publication:
        header: Publishing content
        content: >
            Every piece - book, chapter or scene - can be published. This will create
            a publicly available page with formatted content, which can be shared
            with other people.

    title: Pierwsze kroki
    text:
        1: >
            <a href="%url%" target="_blank">Add a new scene</a>. After providing
            a title and saving, you get full access to all the scene's functionalities.
        2: >
            Having a first scene, you can add characters, items, locations and events
            to it. Changes to the <i>Text</i> field are automatically saved, but other
            fields require manual saving.
        3: >
            If you have enough content, you may want to add another scene. In order to
            group scenes together, you need to
            <a href="%url%" target="_blank">add a new chapter</a>. Then in the scene edit
            form you may assign the newly created chapter and save the changes.
        4: >
            Just like scenes can be grouped into chapters, chapters can be grouped
            within a book. <a href="%url%" target="_blank">Add a new book</a>, so you
            can assign chapters to them in the same manner as scenes to a chapter.
        5: >
            Of course you can always create the book first, then chapter and lastly
            the scene.
        6: >
            Once you are ready to share your work, you can publish selected content.
            Each book, chapter and scene can be published independently, which you can
            do through the <i>Publications</i> tab of their edit form.
